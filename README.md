The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz - 2014 - Subtitles
====================================================================

The goal
--------

We want to make this documentary accessible everywhere in the world even for people who does not speak English.

How
---

At the moment I haven't been able to find subtitles and translations for the documentary "The Internet's own boy: the story of Aaron Swartz" (contact me if they do exist).

We will divide the documentary in short 2 min sections that each of us can sign-up for.

Since the creation process is fast and can be divided more quickly than how fast I can merge a change let use this spreadsheet to 'divide & conquer':

We want to create an English version first then we'll start translating it into other languages ( will add the first draft on transifex.com ).

The result is published here with a CC0 license. 


Notes
-----

If there are sections where you're unsure just leave a [?] question mark in the subtitle, others can review and fix it.

The .srt format requires a sequential number before each displayed text. Unfortunately this sequential numbers makes merges and changes more complex. Will add them at the end once we have a stable subtitle file. Players like VLC do recognize the file even without the sequence anyway so you can test your changes.
