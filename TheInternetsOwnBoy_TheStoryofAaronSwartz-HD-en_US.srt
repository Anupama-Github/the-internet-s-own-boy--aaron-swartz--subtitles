00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:05,790
It's very simple to write a subtitle

00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,790
You just have to specify the time when you want the text to be displayed

00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,790
You can use <i>italic</i> and <b>bold</b>!

00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,321
Make sure you display the sentence long enough to be read :)

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,321
To start choose a section below and replace the <i>lorem ipsum</i> with your name

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,900
Unjust laws exist;

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,600
shall we be content to obey them,

00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,600
or shall we endeavor to amend them,
and obey them until we have succeeded,

00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,600
or shall we transgress them at once?

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,000
Henry David Thoreau

00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,000
The co-founder of the social news and entertainment website "reddit" has been found dead

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,300
He surely was a prodigy althought he never [?] thought of himself like that

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He was totally unexcited about studing businesses and making money

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's a profound sense of loss tonight in Highland Park Aaron Swartz's hometown

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,000
as loved ones say goodbye to one of the Internet's brightest lights

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,500
...Open Access and computer activits are mourning his loss

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
...an astonishing intellect. You talk to people who knew him 

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
...he was killed by the government and MIT betrayed all of its basic principles

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,100
...they wanted to make an example out of it, ok?

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,000
Governments have sensational[?] desire to confront

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,700
...he was potentially facing 35 years in prison and 1 million dollars fine

00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,000
Raising questions of prosecutorial zeal and I would say even miscondut.

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,600
Have you looked into that particular matter and reached any conclusions?


00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,600
Growing up, you know, I slowly had this process of realising that 

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,000
all the things around me, that people had told me

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,900
were just the natural way things were, the way things always would be.

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,600
They weren't natural at all. They were things that could be changed

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,800
and they were thing that more importantly were wrong and should change.

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,600
And once I realised that, there was really kind of no going back

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The Internet's Own Boy

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Welcome to story reading time

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
The name of the book is 'Paddington at the fair'

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Well, he was born in Highland Park and grew up here

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,000
Aaron came from a family of three brothers all extraordinarly bright

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,000
The box is flipping over! 

00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,500
So, we were all, you know, not the best behaved children

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,100
you know, three boys running around all the time, causing trouble

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,100
Mom: No, no, no... Aaron!?
Aaron: What?

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,700
But, I've come to the realization: Aaron learned how to learn at a very young age


00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,700
Toc, toc!?

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Who's here?

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,800
Aaron!

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,000
Aaron who?

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,500
Aaron funny man

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,500
He knew what he wanted, he always wanted to do it. 
He always accomplished what he wanted.

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
His curiosity was endless

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,500
Here's the little picture of a [?] [?]


00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
One day he said to Susan: "Let's do three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park"

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
Three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,000
He was three at the time

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,200
She said: "What are you talking about?"

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,000
He said: "Look it says here on on the refrigerator"

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,000
"Three family entertainment[?] downtown in the park"

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,800
She was flurred and astonished that he could read

00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,800
It's called: "My family seder"

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,800
The seder night is different from all other nights

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,700
I remember once we were are the University of Chicago library

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,100
I pulled a book off the shelf that was like from 1900

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,000
and showed to him, [?]you know this is an extraordinary place

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,000
We all were curious children but Aaron really liked learning and really liked teaching

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:30,000
Today we're going to read the ABC backwards z, y, x, w, ...

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,200
I remember he came home from his first algebra class

00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,000
he was like: "Noah, let me teach you algebra!"

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,000
and I'm like: "What is algebra?"

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,000
and he was always like that

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,200
Now I press button, click button

00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,500
there, now he's got that[?], now it's a pink

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When he was at 2 or 3 three years old an Bob introduced him to computers

00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,700
then he just took off like crazy on them

00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
[?]

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,900
We all had computers, but Aaron really talked to them, really talked to the Internet

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,500
Looking at the computer?

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,900
No, how [?]

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,800
He started programming from a really young age.

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,800
I remember the first program that I wrote with him was in basic

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,000
and  was a Star Wars trivia game

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,500
He sat down with me in the basement were the computer was

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,500
for hours programming this game 

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The problem that I kept having with him was that 
there was nothing that I woudn't done 

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,500
and to him there'sat always something to do
always something that programming could solve 


00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,900
The way that Aaron always thought is that programming is magic

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you can accomplish this things that normal humans can't

00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,800
Aaron made an ATM using like a Macintosh and like a cardboard box

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,700
One year for Halloween I didn't know what I wanted to be 

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,600
and he thought would be really really cool if I dressed up

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,800
like his new favourite computer which at the time was the original iMac

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,500
and he hated dressing up for Hallowen but he loved convincing other people to dress like other things he wanted to see

00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,200
[?]
Guys, come on, look at the camera

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,000
He made this website called "The Info" where people could just fill in information

00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,600
Like, I'm sure someone out there knows all about gold, gold leafing[?].

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
Why aren't they writing about that on this website?

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And then other people can come at a later point and read that information 

00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,500
and edit the information if they thought that it was bad

00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,000
Not too dissimilar from WikiPedia, all right?

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,500
This is before WikiPedia begun

00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,800
and this is developed by a 12 year old 

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,600
in his room, by himself

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,200
running on this tiny server using ancient technology

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,800
One of the teacher's response like:

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,500
"This is a terrible idea, you can't just let anyone author the dictionary, like author the encyclopedia"

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,200
"For a whole reason we have scholars to write these book for us" 

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,200
"How did you ever had such a terrible idea"

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Me and my other brother would be like: "Yeah, you know"

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,800
"WikiPedia is cool but we had that in our house, like 5 years ago"

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:30,000
Aaron's website "The Info.org" wins a school competition hosted by the Cambridge based web design firm ArsDigita

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,900
We all went to Cambridge when he won the ArsDigita Prize

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,900
and, you know, we had no clue of what Aaron was doing

00:07:40,00 --> 00:07:43,500
it was obvious that the pirze was really important

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,700
Aaron soon became involved with on-line programming communities

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,500
than in the process of shaping a new tool for web

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,800
He concept is like[?]: "Ben, there's a really awesome thing that I'm working on"

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,700
"you need to hear about it"

00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,900
I'm like: "Yeah, what is it?"

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,200
He says: "Is this thing called RSS"

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,700
And he explains me what RSS is

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:11,500
and I like: "Why is that useful? Aaron, is a site using it? Why would I want to use it?"

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,400
There was this mailing list for people who were working on RSS and XML more generally

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,300
and there was a person on it named Aaron Swartz 

00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,600
who was combatitive but very smart and who had lots of good ideas

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,700
and he did never come to the face to face meetings

00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,800
and they said: "You know, when are you gonna come to one of those face to face meetings?" 

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,300
He said: "You know, I don't think my mom would let me, you know I just turned 14"

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,900
So the first reaction was, well you know, this person this colleague we've been working with all year 

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,800
was 13 years old when we were working with him and is only 14 now

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,700
and their second reaction was: "Christ, we really want to meet him!"

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
"You know that's extraordinary"

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,900
Was part of the community that drafted RSS

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,700
What he was doing was to help building the plumbing for modern hypertext

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,800
and the piece he was working on, RSS, was a tool that you can use to get summaries

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,500
of things that are going on on other web pages

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,700
Commonly you would use this for a blog 

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,100
You might have 10 or 20 people's blog you wanna read 

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,800
you use the RSS feeds, these summaries of what's going on on those other pages 

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,400
to create a unified list of all the stuff that's going on

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,000
Aaron was really young but he understood the technology

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
and he saw that was imperfect and looked for ways to help make it better 

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,800 
So his mom bundles[?] him on a plane in Chicago, we pick him up in San Francisco 

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,800
we introduced him to interesting people to argue with

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,600
and we marvelled at his horrific eating habits

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,600
he only eat white food, only like, you know, steamed rice

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,800
and not white rice, beacause that was not sufficiently white, and white bread, and so on

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and you kind of marvel at the quality of the debate emerging from what appeared to be a small boy's mouth 

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,600
and you think, this is a kid, is really going to go somewhere if he doesn't die of scroovy[?]


00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,600
Aaron you're up

00:10:06,00 --> 00:10:06,800
I think the difference is that now you can't make companies like that per-se

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,800
you can't have companies that just like "let's sell dog food over the Internet, dog food over the cellphones"

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,800
but there still lot of innovation going on, I think, if you don't see the innovation maybe your head is in the sand


00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,000
He takes on this alpha-male personality where he's sort of like 

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,700
"I'm smarter than you, and because I'm smarter than you I'm better than you, and I can tell you what to do"

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,500
It's an extension of him being like a kind of torpe[?]

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,600
So you aggregate all these computers together and now they're solving big problems

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,000
like searching for aliens or trying to cure cancer


00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:49,600
First I met him on IRC, on Internet Relay Chat, he didn't just write code 

00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,600
he also got people excited about solving problems, he was a connector

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,300
the free culture movement, which[?] had lot of his energy

00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,600
I think Aaron was trying to make the world work.
He was trying to fix it


00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,800
He had a very kind of strong personality, that definetly ruffled[?] feathers at times

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,500
and wasn't necessarily the case that he was always confortable in the world

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
and the world wasn't confortable with him

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,900
Aaron got into high school, and was really just sick of school

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,800
he didn't like it, he didn't like any of the classes he had been taught

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,800
he didn't like the teachers

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,700
Aaron really knew how to get information

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,200
He was like, I don't need to go to these teachers to know how to do geometry

00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I can just read the geometry book

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,400
and I don't need to go to the teacher to learn their version of American history 

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,800
I have like three historical compilations here like I can just read them

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
and I'm not interested in that, I'm interested in the Web


00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
I was very frustrated with school

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,300
I thought, you know, the teachers didn't know what they were talking about

[position]

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,700
they were very domineering and controlling, homework was kind of a sham[?]

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,500
I was just like, you know, all the way are penstick[?] together and force them to do busy work

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,500
and, you know, I started reading books about the history of education and how this educational system was developed

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,300
and, you know, alternative ways to do it[?] people could actually learn things 

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,700
instead of just regurgitating facts that the teachers told them

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,700
and that kind of led me down this path of questioning things

00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,200
and once I questioned the school I was in, I questioned the society that built the school

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,200
I questioned the businesses that the schools were training people for

00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I questioned the government that, you know, setup this whole structure 

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,300
One of the themes he was more passionate about was copyright, especially in those early days 

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,600
Copyright has always been something overburden on publishing industry and on readers

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,900
but it wasn't an excessive burden

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,200
it was a reasonable institution to have in place
to make sure that people got paid

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,100
What Aaron generation experienced was the collision

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,800
between this antique copyright system

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,700
and this amazing new thing we were trying to build, the Internet and the Web

00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,000
These things collided and what we got was chaos


00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,400
He then met Harward law professot Lawrence Lessig

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,700
who was then challenging copyright law in the supreme court

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,200
A young Aaron Swartz flew to Washington to listen to the supreme court hearings

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm Aaron Swartz and I'm here to listen to the Eldred ...to see the Eldred argument

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:23,000
Why did you fly out here from Chicago and come all this way to see the Eldred argument?

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
That's a more difficult question

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,700
I don't know, I'm very excited to see the supreme court 

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,400
especially in such a prestigious case as this one

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Lessig was also moving forward with a new way to define copyright on the Internet

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,800
it was called Creative Commons

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,800
So the simple idea of Creative Commons is to give people, creators

00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,800
a simple way to mark their creativity

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,600
with the freedoms they intended to carry

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,700
So copyright is about "all rights reserved"

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,900
then this is a kind of "some rights reserved" bottle[?]

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,400
It's I want a simple way to say to you "here's what you can do with my work"

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,800
even if there are other things which you need to get my permission before you could do

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,400
And Aaron's role was the computer part

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
like how do you architect the licenses 

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,300
so that would be simple and understandable and expressed in way that machines could process it

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,800
And people are like, why do you have this fifteen year old kid

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,000
writing the specifications of creative commons?

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,100
like, don't you think that's a huge mistake?

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,600
and larry is like: "the biggest mistake that we would have is not listening to this kid"

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,200
embarrassing[?] is not even tall enough to get over the podium

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,300
and it wasn't one of those movable podiums

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,600
so this embarrassing thing that once he put his screen up nobody could see his face

00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:49,000
When we come to our website here

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,500
and we've got few licences 

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,600
it gives you this list of options explaining what it means

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
and we thought three set of questions

00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,600
Do you want to require attribution?

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,600
Do you want to allow commercial uses of your work?

00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,700
Do you want to allow modifications of your work?

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,900
I was floored

00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,800
just completely fiberglassed that these adults regarded him as an adult

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Aaron stood up there in front an whole audience full of people 

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and just started talking about the platform that he created for Creative Commons

00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,800
And they where all listening to him, just

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,600
I was sitting AT the back thinking: 
"he's just a kid, why're listening to him?"

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,700
but they did

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,400
well I don't think I comprehended it fully

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Though critics have said that it does little to ensure artists get payed for their work

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,000
the success of Creative Commons has been enourmous

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,700
Currently on the website flickr alone over 200 million people use some form of Creative Commons license

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:51,400
He contributed through his technical abilities 

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,600
and yet it was not simply a technical matter to him

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600 
Aaron Often wrote candidly in his personal blog

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,600 
I think deeply about things and I want others to do likewise.

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,800 
I work for ideas and learn from people. I don’t like excluding people. 

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,800 
I’m a perfectionist, but I won’t let that get in the way of publication.

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,300 
Except for education and entertainment, I’m not going to waste my time on things that won’t have impact. 

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,800 
I try to be friends with everyone, but I hate it when you don’t take me seriously. 

00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,800
I don’t hold grudges (it’s not productive) but I learn from my experience. 

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,000
I want to make the world a better place.

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,700
In 2004 Swartz leaves Highland Park and enrolls in Stanford University 

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,800
He had also diverticolite[?] which was very troubling 

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,900
and we were concerned about him taking his medications.

00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,200
He got hospitalized and he would take this cocktail pills everyday

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,200
and one of these pills was a steroid which dauted his growth and 

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,600
made him feel different from any of the other students
